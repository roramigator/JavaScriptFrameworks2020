# Effects Challenge 2 - Making Multiple AJAX Requests

In Visual Studio code, press `command+shift+v` (Mac) or `ctrl+shift+v` (Windows) to open a Markdown preview.

## Reason for the Challenge

As Front-End Engineers, we often have to work with APIs, so that we can communicate with a back-end. For example, we can use APIs to store content, modify content, display content on the screen and integrate with third-party services. Understanding the useEffect hook will enable you to make AJAX requests to different APIs.

## Getting Started

Using your command line, you will need to navigate to the this folder, install all dependencies, and start the app.

```bash
cd exercises/09c-use-effect/
code . # if you would like to open this in a separate VSCode window
yarn install
yarn start
```

**NOTE that when you start this application, you will see the compilation errors. You will fix this.**

## User Stories

As a user, I want to select a Rick and Morty from a list of characters so that I can see the character's name and what he or she looks like.

![What should happen after a user selects a character](rick-morty2.png)

## Acceptance Criteria

- The application should make AJAX requests to the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).
- The application should use the useEffect hook at least once.
- Immediately after the component first renders, it should get a list of characters and display the character names as choices in a dropdown.
- When the user selects a character from the dropdown, the application should look up more information on the character. When the AJAX request finishes, the character's name and image should appear on the screen.

## Instructions

Before doing this exercise, read the documentation for [getting all Rick and Morty characters](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-all-characters) and [looking up a single Rock and Morty character](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#get-a-single-character).

If you would like to use the Axios library, install it with `yarn add axios`. (`create-react-app` doesn't come with the Axios library, so you will need to install it separately.) Alternatively, you can use the browser native Fetch API.

When you do `yarn start`, the application will still fail to compile. This is because you need to plugin a character list, name and image, which you will get from the APIs. When the content isn't there because it is loading, you will either need to use default values or conditional rendering. You can use this image as the default image:
