## Course Description

This is an intermediate to advance front-end web development course focused on teaching how to write web applications in JavaScript. We will dive into JavaScript frameworks, focusing on [React](https://reactjs.org/). You will earn JSX, the virtual DOM, how to modularize your code into components and many of the tools available to manage and share state. We may also cover JavaScript libraries like [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Immer.js](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/docs/introduction), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) and [React CSS Transition Group](https://reactjs.org/docs/animation.html). As a bonus, we will explore the world of building mobile applications with [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

This course will also introduce you to the tools and practice of the trade. This includes working with command line, version control with git, code reviews, unit testing and Scrum methodology. Software developers from local firms will visit the class to provide an employer contact and student mentorship.

## Class Policies

### Class Announcements & Other Communications

Most of the class communication will take place on Slack. Please check it regularly. The class’s public channel is _#js-fall-2019_.

### Grading

In order to receive a certificate of completion, you must attend class and you must submit your work. However, we are willing to be flexible in special circumstances. Please contact the program director and your instructors _as soon as possible_ if something serious is preventing you from particpating or submitting your work.

#### Participation

AlbanyCanCode will ask you to attend at least 80% of classes in order to receive a certificate. If you receive funding, you must pyshcially attend at least 50% of all classes.

#### Projects

There will be three or four projects in total depending on time; two or three smaller individual projects and one large, final group projects. You will be able to resubmit your indvidual projects for a better grade. If you do not turn in your class projects at the end of class, you may not receive a certificate of completion.

### Assignments

In addition to your projects, you will be completeting in-class and take-home assignments. While you will not be graded on these assignments, we encourage that you do your assignments for your personal benefit. We will ask you to submit your work through GitHub pull requests so that we can view your progress.

### Getting Help

If you find that you have any trouble keeping up with assignments or other aspects of the course, make sure you let AlbanyCanCode know as early as possible. As you will find, building rapport and effective relationships are key to becoming an effective professional.

While Jamal and Matina would like to help you any way we can, your instructors do have full-time jobs outside of this class and are not always available. We encourage you to message the class channel or ask other students for help. Our program director Greg is also available for 1-on-1 help sessions.

If you have a disability and would like to request accommodations, please contact the instructors during the first week of the semester so that your accommodations may be provided in a timely manner.

### Dropping the Class

If you must drop the course, please contact Annmarie Lanesey at annmarie@albanycancode.org and notify the instructors.
